# Pygame: Alien_Invasion
In this project we will utilize the Pygame package to develop a 2D game that uses classes and methods to manage the game’s functionality. This project will consist of 9 different classes that will control various aspects of the game such as the movement of the images and the display of the window.
In this 2D game, the player’s objective is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen. The player moves the ship left and right with the arrow keys and shoots the bullets using the spacebar. If the player shoots all the aliens in the fleet, the fleet reappears from the top of the screen and moves faster than the fleet in the previous level. If any of the aliens in the fleet hits the ship or touches the bottom of the screen, the level restarts. When the player loses three ships, the game ends.
